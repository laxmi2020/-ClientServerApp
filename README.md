Client-Server Communication Application
What is This Project?
This project is a simple program that shows how two computers can talk to each other over the internet. It uses two methods: TCP and UDP.

What You Will Learn
How TCP allows a reliable connection to send messages.
How UDP lets you send messages quickly without needing a connection.
How to send and receive messages between a client (the sender) and a server (the receiver).
Features
TCP Server and Client:

The TCP server receives messages from clients and sends them back (echoes).
UDP Server and Client:

The UDP server receives messages without needing a direct connection and replies.
How to Get Started
Requirements
You need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.
Running the Application
Run the TCP Server:

Open your command prompt or terminal.
Go to the folder where you saved the project files.
Run this command:

python tcp_server.py
Run the TCP Client:

Open another command prompt or terminal.
Go to the same project folder.
Run this command:

python tcp_client.py
You can type messages in this window to send to the server.
Run the UDP Server:

Open another command prompt or terminal.
Go to the same project folder.
Run this command:

python udp_server.py
Run the UDP Client:

Open another command prompt or terminal.
Go to the same project folder.
Run this command:

python udp_client.py
Type messages in this window to send to the server.
Summary
This project helps you understand how computers communicate using TCP and UDP methods. Feel free to try it out, make changes, and learn more!
